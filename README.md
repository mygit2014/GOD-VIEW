**GOD-VIEW Outside of the Local Network**

**What GOD-VIEW Doesn’t Implement**

Introduction
------------

### What is GOD-VIEW?
GOD-VIEW is a networking application, with the name referring to a view
from up above, the all seeing eye. GOD-VIEW is the third iteration of
developing a Remote Access Tool, driven by the motivation of
understanding the web, it’s foundation, but more specifically the
communication between computers in networks & processes. This might seem
simple, but it has a multitude of layers below when it comes to
development of a truly great program. Gathering from my previous
attempts which started with the NexRAT
([*https://github.com/Alvin-22/NexRAT*](https://github.com/Alvin-22/NexRAT))
project & continued by NeoRAT
([*https://github.com/Alvin-22/NeoRAT*](https://github.com/Alvin-22/NeoRAT)),
both of which are available on Github as open source projects with major
flaws. But these projects provide the foundation of how communication
between networks & processes can look.

In practice GOD-VIEW hosts a TCP socket that the client connects to & a
HTTP server that communicates with the server through a websocket
allowing real time communication.

### What Does GOD-VIEW Achieve?
The GOD-VIEW program supports a large amount of powerful features, that
I will discuss later on. But on a foundational level, GOD-VIEW allows
for secure, fast & non-limiting communication between it’s server &
clients. It accepts connections using the TCP transport protocol & works
with streams of data. It keeps these connections alive by sending beacon
messages in intervals & provides persistent attempts to connect /
reconnect if it fails to establish a connection or in the case that the
connection is ever closed with the server.

This might seem non-descriptive or difficult to understand what it
means, but it will all make sense as I will in detail walk through
everything the application archives & how the program works.

### Who can use GOD-VIEW?
The program makes availability one of its core foundational beliefs.
GOD-VIEW supports the Windows, Linux & Mac operating systems.

Both the server & client program supports these operating systems. The
server also supports a Desktop GUI application that requires Google
Chrome installed. This GUI application can also be used in a browser,
this does not require Google Chrome installed. This desktop / web GUI
supports all major browsers except for Internet Explorer with device
support from 320x320+ (iPhone 5+) & supports mobile specific
interactions when right clicks for example is not possible.

The program also supports both the IPV4 & IPV6 protocols & can be run
from any directory on the filesystem (all paths are accepted, relative
or absolute).

Overall GOD-VIEW is very flexible & supports all the major operating
systems & different ways to interact with an application, be it through
the terminal, desktop or web.

GOD-VIEW also supports running the program with an interpreter or as an
executable.

### What Makes GOD-VIEW Different?
The things that make GOD-VIEW different can be both seen as positive &
negative. The major difference is the availability as mentioned. It also
provides a neat & well thought out design, with soothing color schemes &
responsive action-reaction design thinking. It provides for
beginner-to-advanced usage, but always, even when used in the terminal
with describing colors & never leaves with the “what is happening”
interaction.

The desktop / web is built using sustainable methods & complete custom
design.

The availability is not the only thing that is different, GOD-VIEW
provides an extremely powerful zero-limitations of actions when it comes
to performing a command to 1 or 100 clients at the same time, however
taxing / complex the command is, with no extra delay between responses
from every client. GOD-VIEW also never writes / stores anything on the
client’s filesystem.

### How was GOD-VIEW Built?
GOD-VIEW was built using the Python (blessing & a curse) programming
language, following the object oriented paradigm, for the client /
server & supports *Python 3.7+*.

The program also utilizes third party libraries, which are required,
with specific intentions to avoid bloating the program. These can be
installed using *pip* / direct download link to a .whl file. The program
uses multiple formats to store data, using sqlite3 for the local
database, text files, csv files & the PNG format for images.

To build the executable file requires *pyinstaller* to be in the path
variable.

The desktop / web GUI was built using ReactJS with
TypeScript**\[front-end\]**, redux for global state management & styled
components for the custom design. It communicates with the server using
websockets **\[back-end\]**.

As mentioned previously, the desktop GUI requires *Google Chrome*
installed & if it’s not available will default to web GUI.

### Surveillance
GOD-VIEW supports multiple ways of gathering large amounts of
information, with 30 data points upon initial connection, this is among
other things the country, operating system, antivirus & privileges of
the connected client.

There is also more specific information that can be gathered about the
clients which are about the GPU, CPU, Memory, Disk, Network & IO.
**\[Sysinfo\]**

GOD-VIEW provides the ability to upload files from the server or an URL
& the option to execute this file upon upload. It’s also possible to
download files or directories to the server & execute the file upon
successful download. **\[Upload / Download\]**

The recover commands allow you to get the WIFI passwords stored on the
client's computer, the browser history & bookmarks of most browsers.
**\[Recover\]**

You can capture a screenshot of one or all monitors & have the options
to display the image on the server. You also have the option to take a
snapshot from the webcam, working the same as taking a screenshot, but
without the option of taking a single snapshot of all connected webcams.
**\[Screenshot / Snapshot\]**

### Action
The action namespace holds commands with the intent to perform specific
system actions. You can shutdown, restart, logout, hibernate & standby
the clients computer. **\[System\]**

You can alert the client’s computer with a messagebox, of which you can
set the title, the text & specify the symbol of the messagebox. The
symbol can represent a question, information, danger or warning.
**\[Alert\]**

The process command allows you to list all running tasks & the clients
open network connections, providing information about them. You then
have the option to kill anyone of these processes. **\[Process\]**

The clipboard command allows you to copy data to the clipboard, empty
the clipboard & get the data of the clipboard. **\[Clipboard\]**

The browse command allows you to enter one or more URLs to be opened in
the default browser of the client system. **\[Browse\]**

### Execution
When it comes to the execution namespace, it holds some of the most
interesting & vital commands. It allows inline injection of keyboard /
mouse actions or running a script from a file. The language of this
injection is GOD-VIEW’s own. It’s very simple & not very strict.

The language consists of key, value pairs, separated by a space.

**press \[Key / Button\]**

**hold \[Key / Button\]**

**release \[Key / Button\]**

**type \[Text\]**

**position \[X,Y\]**

**move \[X,Y\]**

**scroll \[X,Y\]**

**mhold \[Mouse Button\]**

**mrelease \[Mouse Button\]**

**click \[Mouse Button\]**

**dclick \[Mouse Button\]**

*Unique flow control commands*

* **sleep \[Seconds\]**
* **repeat \[Times\]**
  * Repeats all subsequent actions for Z times, this is recursive &
    * allows nested repeat statements.

* **\[position / move / scroll\] random \[min X, max X,min Y,max Y\]**
  * Can be used by any command taking an X & Y parameter, &
    * requires instead of X & Y four values, for the minimum &
      maximum random value for the X, respectively the Y.

The injection command can be used to perform automated keyboard / mouse
activity, supporting recursive loops & random coordinates, making it
quite a powerful tool. **\[Inject\]**

Next there is the python command, allowing the inline execution of
Python code. Everything that would be written to the terminal on the
client’s computer will instead be read on the server, making it
seamlessly natural. This command also supports, like injection,
execution from a file. **\[Python\]**

Finally, arguably the most important command in GOD-VIEW, is the shell
command, allowing the remote execution of terminal commands. A reverse
shell, supporting all commands. Commands that do not return any data
will time out, after Z amount of time, therefore interactive programs
like Python or Node would simply timeout. **\[Shell\]**

### Management
The management namespace is about simplifying tasks & specifying how the
program shall operate. This is done with the blacklist command by
allowing the rejection of specific connecting IP addresses. The alias
command allows the translation of a word written using the server's
terminal to a corresponding value. Then there is the very powerful
autotask command, giving great freedom & automation, for the simple
reason that any command that interacts with clients is supported. It
will perform the request upon connection of the client & write the
results to a text file. Finally, also one of the most important &
influential commands is the environment command. It holds a number of
variables that have a great impact on how the program will run, for
example alerting an email upon client connection. **\[Blacklist / Alias
/ Autotask / Environment\]**

### Connection
The connection namespace focuses on the handling of anything that
specifically handles the connection or the file on the client’s
filesystem. Starting off by targeting persistence of the client program,
by having the program run even after the computer shuts off or the user
logs out. This is done with the autostart directory, to schedule a task,
or by adding an autostart registry key, these features are Windows
specific & won’t work on any other operating system & would require
other implementations. **\[Autostart\]**

The session & delete commands allow specifying which clients to either
interact with or to remove. **\[Session / Delete\]**

Additional quite straight forward commands are disconnect, reconnect &
uninstall. Disconnect might seem like the delete command just mentioned,
but has the specific difference in that it makes the client exit itself,
which won’t have the client reconnecting until it’s rerun, which delete
does not always guarantee. Uninstall removes all registry keys made for
persistence along with any autostart files & finally removes itself.
**\[Disconnect / Reconnect / Uninstall\]**

Lastly we have an important command, only supported in Windows, again,
which is escalate. It will try to perform an user authentication bypass
(UAC) bypass, rerunning the program with administrative privileges
without ever having to ask the user. **\[Escalate\]**

### Utility
The utility namespace is very straight forward, with a couple of
commands that support the general flow of the program. The build command
allows you to build GOD-VIEW into an executable program, being able to
build any file, specify the icon & if it should have a window or be a
background process. **\[Build\]**

Next is the note command, this simply writes the data to a text file,
with an attached timestamp. **\[Note\]**

The who command is especially neat for the terminal, as it will list
every single data point of a specific connected client. **\[Who\]**

The gui command will simply reopen the desktop application, to be used
in case you close the window. **\[Gui\]**

### Live
Live is one of the most challenging namespaces, these are the most
powerful commands GOD-VIEW has to offer, providing live streams of data,
each with their own socket connection. This holds a difficult challenge
of having different types of client connections to the server if the
server is to be only hosted on a single socket, or if multiple sockets
should be opened on the server for each one of these live streams of
data. You also have the problem of not wanting the client to be able to
dictate when a certain stream of data should be opened, as the client
has to connect to the server first. The solution was a token-like
system, generating a universally unique id on the server side, allowing
the connection with this token to be accepted if sent by the client
within X amount of time, of which the token is valid, this requires the
server to always initiate the request of a specific connection type from
the client & is a great solution for the reason of only requiring a
single server socket.

The audio command enables the microphone, allowing a live audio stream
of the microphone to the server & be directly streamed to the default
output device. Making the client a hot-mic.

The next command is desktop, it provides an extremely powerful &
relatively smooth stream, the FPS is not going to be the highest, the
performance will be based on the screen size & the power of the
computer. It’s optimized for performance, but because it uses PNG
compression, it does not support lowering the resolution, which can make
the stream performance very image-size dependent. The stream is
optimized by splitting up the work of taking the screenshot & sending
it, making it more resource intensive, but with performance
improvements, but is still throttled by the TCP-protocol bottleneck.
**\[Desktop\]**

The modules command provides an overview of all running live streams,
with the ability to close any stream. **\[Modules\]**

The webcam command works very similar to desktop & usually has very good
performance, this is because the webcam size is usually a lot smaller,
making the frame rate much higher. This is only supported on Windows
though, because it’s not utilizing opencv, to avoid bloating the program
on the client side, instead a library called VideoCapture is used, which
uses the Windows DirectShow API. **\[Webcam\]**

Finally we have the logger commands, keylogger & clipper. These commands
record keystrokes & the clipboard data to be written to files on the
server, providing client side timestamps & fair representation of
performed actions. **\[Keylogger / Clipper\]**

### Multiplex
The multiplex namespace has only two commands, all & close. These will
simply add every connected client to the session or remove every single
client from the session. **\[All / Close\]**

### Terminal
This namespace refers to commands that are primarily used in the
terminal of the server, as it’s features are utilized by default in the
desktop / web GUI. Alternatively are they specifically to be used only
by the terminal. The clear command simply clears out the terminal, the
help command lists all available commands, listing their names,
arguments & all the data necessary about the command to be used. Then we
have the list command, which lists data about all the connected clients
& finally the exit command which simply closes the program. **\[Clear /
Help / List / Exit\]**

The Different Ways of Running GOD-VIEW 
---------------------------------------

The GOD-VIEW program accepts a few command line arguments. These are to
specify the type of way you want to run the program, but cannot be given
the freedom to be changed like environment variables during runtime.
These are the -TERMINAL argument, which only runs the terminal of the
server, without the desktop / web GUI. Then there is the -WEB argument,
which will run the program with the terminal, but also hosts the web
GUI, this will limit some functionality, but can be used in the case
that the primary usage will be with a browser. The disabled features are
to show screenshots / snapshots taken, nor can the desktop, audio or
webcam command be used. By default GOD-VIEW runs as both a terminal &
desktop / web GUI.

You can specify the address with -IP, TCP port with -PORT & the HTTP
port by specifying -GUI\_PORT. You may also specify the -SECRET & -SALT
of the asymmetric encryption key to be used by the server.

The desktop / web GUI does not support exactly every command, you cannot
exit from the GUI, it’s only available to the terminal, you can also not
clear the terminal window of the server on the desktop / web GUI.

There are slight limitations when running the client as a non-executable
file. You cannot do anything that requires the executable file to exist.
This includes autostart, reconnect, uninstall & escalate.

Program / File structure
------------------------

**host.py**
* Starts the server threads, this includes hosting the TCP server, the
  * messaging thread & the desktop / web HTTP server.

**bot.py**
* Starting the main thread, connecting to the remote server, which is
  * started by running the host.py file.

**archive**
* Contains all program data, server logs, database file & client
  * specific files. The files are automatically generated & the file
  * structure organized as such, this file can be deleted at any time,
  * without ever disturbing anything during runtime.

**build**
* Files that are related to running & installing the program & acts as
  * a miscellaneous directory.

**gui**
* The necessary desktop / web GUI production build files, required to
  * be in the root directory of which the program is run.

**exe**
* Stores the executable build files generated using the build command.

**client**
* Stores client specific behaviour & implementations. To support all
  * the client functionality & to fulfill requests.

**server**
* The server specific files, but also the GUI application. This is a
  * large majority of the program, as this handles everything, not
  * just following directions like the client.

**shared**
* Files that both the client & server can share, to reuse the same
  * implementations, this has a lot to do with sending & receiving the
  * data & shared state.

GOD-VIEW Outside of the Local Network
-------------------------------------

To be able for remote connections to be made to the server & to host the
server for the internet is quite simple. With three alternatives, either
use a port tunneling service like ngrok, which practically does the port
forwarding for you. The second choice is to do the port forwarding of
your router yourself. The third option would be to remotely host the
program & enable the -WEB command line argument.

**Ngrok**
* Download ngrok at [*https://ngrok.com/*](https://ngrok.com/)
* Make sure ngrok is in the path variable or in your current directory
* **ngrok tcp -region=eu 5658**
  * Running this makes the TCP server available to the internet.
* **ngrok http -region=us 8565**
  * Running this makes the HTTP web GUI available to the internet.

After this, you would simply change the *Static.IP* & *Static.PORT* in
the *GOD-VIEW/client/state.py* file to the IP & port ngrok redirects
traffic from, for example *tcp.eu.ngrok.io* & *1832*. Note that if
you’re using ngrok to access the web application, it does not support
HTTPS, so you have to use the HTTP version. This is sadly the library
limitation of which is used for the GUI.

What GOD-VIEW Doesn’t Implement
-------------------------------

There are things not implemented, this is because it might not fit the
flow of the program, it requires third-party libraries not worth using
for the features it would bring. The Python language has difficulty
implementing certain features neatly, or it’s difficult to implement
cross platform solutions for.

Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) server, supporting real time
streaming. There are great servers for RTMP, one of them being
Node-Media-Server
([*https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server*](https://github.com/illuspas/Node-Media-Server)),
but uses NodeJS which makes it difficult to implement interactions with
the server. But it also requires large streaming libraries, most
commonly used being FFMPEG, which is a big hassle. But the GOD-VIEW GUI
still allows you to read RTMP streams supporting flv.js
([*https://github.com/Bilibili/flv.js/*](https://github.com/Bilibili/flv.js/))
using the sidebar.

Another feature not implemented is a true remote desktop, most likely
not terribly difficult to implement using the pywin32 library, but
because it might clutter the flow of the program & also focuses a lot on
specifically Windows only functionality, it’s not been tested or
implemented.

Toast notifications, with my will of not using the pywin32 library being
strong as it would simply put so much focus & possibility to Windows
only functionality. GOD-VIEW worked around these problems with
notifications by implementing server terminal connection notifications,
the possibility for email notifications & GUI notifications with audio
sound & a visual alert.

GOD-VIEW avoided a lot of the malicious intent features, such as more
extensive password grabbers / cookie stealers, specific features
targeting DDOS attacks & reverse proxies. Simply because of the lack of
need for any of these features, interest in them. It does not include
anything to do with encryption of files, as it’s simply not the intent
of the program.

Avoiding more \~basic features, such as the active window for the
keylogger / clipper & fun functions, changing wallpaper, playing sounds,
CD-popout along with other things, are not implemented as I cannot be
bothered, a lot of these require operating system specific
implementations or Windows only implementations & the pywin32 library.
Still wanting to hold most functionality cross platform.

Lastly, what's not implemented is any virtual machine (VM) detection &
obfuscation. This is also not the intent of the program, but also,
especially VM detection from what I've seen are implementations
supporting Windows only. The program does not try to obfuscate anything,
it’s written in Python, not C, C++, C\# or Delphi. It can be done, but
has very little purpose to be supported by GOD-VIEW.
